The beginning of the book was quite shocking and made the reader holds his breath, as the story keeps unfolding with every chapter,
the reader learns more and more about the horrific events that took place during the world war two and its effects on a teenage girl
who was strongly attached to her father. The journey is heartbreaking and even more twisted by the end of the war.  The effects of being 
separated from your one hero at an early age has had a great impact on the entire life of the writer. She described the slow painful 
transition she had from a normal teenage girl to a war prisoner then the second transition equally painful from a war prisoner to a war
survivor. However, as you approach the end of the book, the historical aspect of the biography slowly fades as the writer expresses her
opinion on recent matters that the readers have more knowledge of than WW2, like the Israeli war as she called it, terrorism and the racism
towards religion. I had to disagree with some of her opinions and even blame her a little for leaving some important details while assessing 
the situation. It felt like she was still a little lost girl that is completely blinded by her father dreams and could not see the things for
what they were because of the deep personal involvement she had. But I really hope she did find the peace she was looking for in her last sentence.

★★★☆☆
