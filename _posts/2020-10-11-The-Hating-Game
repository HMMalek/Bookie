This book is really fun, it makes you laugh, wonder and smile warmly
I loved every bit of it
If you are sad and need something to ease your mind, relieve your stress this is your go to book.
It took me 3 days to finish it (note: I was really busy) but I think it could be read in one sitting.
the pickering of these two love birds gives you butterflies in the stomach and the extent they go to in order to prove their love is amazing.
I love this light-lovely book!!
I give 4 stars out of five.
