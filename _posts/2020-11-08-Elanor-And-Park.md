Overall I think this book is good. I was captivated by the characters and got emotionally involved...
It got really interesting in the middle and you would expect something more than what it is given by the end. 
I wanted to see more into the characters 's futures and I expected something more dynamic . I just felt like the build up was too soon melting ...
But it still illustrated the struggles and the innocent love of young teenagers. 
Also i think this story is actually about telling people to stop judging a book by its cover , accepting others as they are,
loving their differences and trying to understand them as they might surprise you by who they really are.

★★★☆☆
