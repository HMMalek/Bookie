This book is an eye opener, it talks about the cruelty of war, the things women have to go through at the time of war, the sacrifice of a mother...
It gives you an idea about the Afghan society at different phases in time and the history of the country. It also deals with a lot of issues that are present not only in Afghanistan but other countries.
I truly loved it but I didn't give it 5 stars cause at some point I lost hope for the characters and had no expectations except for their death.
