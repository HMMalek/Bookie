This book is amazingly written.
It was full of surprises till the end. When I turned the last page I was still expecting more but then realized that was it..
I had different twisted feelings reading this and I kept changing my mind about the characters over an dover again. I found myself wondering what if too many times
But it was amazing, Nick is just a regular guy that was shaped at the end by Amy, he would never look at her the same again. Amy however, went beyond all my expectations, her character
was a mystery since the beginnig and one page at a time you would discover something new, some people may see her as manipulative person, others will see her as a sociopath or maybe even a victim
but I feel like she is all that in one person...
Keeping this spoiler-free so one thing left to say : I loved this book!
Four stars cause I wanted more, I wanted for everyone to get what they deserve but they didn't, maybe it's more realistic this way.
